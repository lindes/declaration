Brainstorming on the Declaration of Independence, and the future of Interdependence

* "When in the course of human events"

That's now!

* "All men"

And women, and...  All people (homo sapiens), at least... and really,
probably even other species, as well.

* "Created Equal"

Not really.  We're not all identical.  Especially when you get into
multiple species.  But that doesn't mean we're not equal in some
ways... we're all life forms, we're all on this earth, we all have a
mother (or, in the case of certain species, a parent in some other
form)... we may not *be* equal, but we're equally members of the
biosphere, or whatever term you want to use.

* Bonds...
