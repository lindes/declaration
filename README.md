Declaration of Interdependence

It seems to me that the idea of "independence", while surely quite
useful for the colonies at the time of the American Revolution, is one
that is at this point outdated and harmful.  It's time for us to
progress to Interdependence.  This is my attempt to document my
thoughts on this, adapting, in part, that prior document, and
incorporating new ideas as well.
